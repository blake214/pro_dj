In this 2nd-year university project, I harnessed the capabilities of the JUCE C++ library to create a versatile music player. At its core, this project focuses on delivering an immersive music playback experience with an emphasis on mixing and control.

**Highlights:**
- JUCE-Powered: Developed a feature-rich music player using the JUCE C++ framework, I developed a music player that blends audio expertise with intuitive graphical user interfaces.
- Intuitive User Interface: The project is an easy-to-navigate user interface, enabling users to effortlessly import, play, and blend music tracks.
- Real-Time Mixing: Enriched the player with real-time mixing capabilities, allowing users to create customized music blends and transitions effortlessly.
- Precise Control: Provided precise control over individual tracks, including volume, equalization, and synchronization.

**Installation / Run**
To experience this application, building it is a prerequisite. I have provided and thoroughly tested build files for Linux.

## Features
#### Supports Uncompressed WAV Format
The player offers compatibility with uncompressed WAV audio format, ensuring a wide range of audio sources can be played.

#### Multi-Deck Capability
Users can add and remove up to four decks, allowing simultaneous playback and mixing of multiple tracks. This multi-deck feature opens the door to creative and dynamic music arrangements.

#### Interactive Mixing
Interaction with the decks is facilitated through an interactive controller, enabling smooth fades and transitions between tracks.

#### Control Sliders and Buttons
Each deck comes equipped with its own set of sliders and buttons, including:

**Sliders:**
- Tempo
- Pitch
- Highs
- Lows
- Track Position

**Buttons:**
- Play
- Pause
- Stop
- Toggle looping
- Toggle mute
- Delete deck
- Minimize deck
- Playlist

#### Playlist
The application incorporates a playlist feature, allowing users to curate and manage their music collection. Users can drag and drop tracks into the playlist or navigate the file browser to add songs. The playlist is saved locally, preserving its state across application sessions.

#### Smart Search
For added convenience, the playlist includes a search box that allows users to search for tracks by typing characters, making track selection more efficient.

This music player project exemplifies my commitment to delivering immersive and innovative audio solutions, combining the power of JUCE with a user-friendly interface to enhance the music listening and mixing experience
